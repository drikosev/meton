 The day script accepts dates in the AD era and thus one can't use it directly to
 compute the days passed between two dates if the older one is in the BC era. Now 
 we'll see an example that could be used as a basis for such computations. Let us
 assume we want to compute ie the days passed from Jan 1, 357 BC to Jan 1, 960 AD. 

 Since both years are leap and both months and days are identical we will compute 
 instead the period from Jan 1, 960 AD until Jan 1, 2276. Because 1316 years have 
 passed from 357 BC until 960 AD. We now compute and subtract the number of days:
 
   ./day --use 2276-01-01,00:01,001
   830944

   ./day --use 0960-01-01,00:01,001
   350275
   ------
   480669                               (manual subtraction)


  As a proof, we will cross-check the result with three different criteria; namely
  years, weeks, and moon phases.
 
  If we divide the number 480669 by 365.25 which is the average length of a Julian
  year, then the result is 1316. So, this period is precisely 1316 years.

  To cross check the weeks we can use a formula from the translation of the Easter
  table, which reports that both these Julian years start on a Sunday. Indeed, the
  number 480669 is divisible by 7. So this period is precisely 68667 weeks.

  Finally, we can read from online servers that both dates have a new moon. If we
  divide 480669 / 29,530588861 then we take the result of 16276,98663 lunar months
  and even if we divide 480669 / 29,53059426 the result is 16276,98365. Thus, once
  rounded this period is approximately 16277 lunar months, in both cases. Whereas,
  the 1468 years cycle gives us a new moon on Jan 1, 1112 AD and 28 divides 1316.

  We therefore conclude that 480669 days passed from Jan 1, 357 BC to Jan 1, 960 AD,
  which is exactly 1316 years, which is exactly equal to 68667 weeks, which is also
  approximately 16277 lunar months with an error of less than 18 hours [1]. By taking
  into account years, weeks, and moon phases we've triple-checked the result.
  
  Admittedly, the required actions aren't as simple & convenient as the subtraction
  of two Julian days and I hope to find the time & improve the day script as needed.


 Notes
 [1] According to astropixels.com the error is nearly two hours and forty one minutes.
     As it seems, the new moon on 1/1/357 BC should be close to the sunset of that day
     and possibly in some geographic regions this new moon coincided with the sunset.
     With a draft computation, I see a 30 minutes lunar-solar gap in Beirut, and one
     hour in Athens (again: be aware that the computation is draft & approximative). 
 [2] A new moon on Sunday, January the first in a leap year recurred also in 1576, 616
     years after 960, but early in the morning (moongiant.com reports 05:29). Such a
     synchronisation may recur at a minimum of 84 years. The recurred period of 1316
     years is a combination of 616 and 84 (2*616+84).

     Note: A synchronisation of that kind in the beginning of the year may appear
           after 666 years with the New Moon and the Full Moon inverted, on the
           same month day and weekday, if we start counting from a leap year or
           the previous one. Yet, the number 666 isn't divisible by 4 and we've
           to expect several hours shifting of the lunar event in the solar day.
           That explained, the inversion below appears on the last day of January. 


            Year   New Moon.            Full Moon            New Moon
           -0356   Sun, Jan  1  13:36   Sun, Jan 15  17:53   Thu, Jan 31  00:42
           
            0310   Full Moon            New Moon             Full Moon
                   Mon, Jan  2  08:19   Thu, Jan 17  14:14   Thu, Jan 31  19:09


            As it seems the example above and the numbers in it don't explain any
            allegory and in fact, finding similar examples is more difficult than
            finding examples for synchronisations that recur after 616 years.
