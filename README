-The bash script "easter" calculates the Greek Orthodox Easter Day (from 1924).
 Greece adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1923, one year earlier than the Greek
 Orthodox Church. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar

-The bash script "julian" converts a given Gregorian Calendar date (from 1582) 
 to the corresponding date of the Julian Calendar. These two calendars diverge 
 3 days every 400 years (on the average almost 1 day every 7 Metonic cycles).

 If no date is specified, the script converts the current date returned by the
 bash shell command "date" with the following format:

 $ date +"%Y-%m-%d,%H:%M,%j"
 2018-02-27,17:35,058
 $ ./julian
 2018-02-14,17:35,045

 Here are a few typical examples:

 $ ./julian --use 2101-01-15,00:01,15
 2101-01-01,00:01,001
 $ ./julian --use 1901-01-14,00:01,14
 1901-01-01,00:01,001
 $ ./julian --use 1801-01-13,00:01,13
 1801-01-01,00:01,001
 $ ./julian --use 1701-01-12,00:01,12
 1701-01-01,00:01,001
 $ ./julian --use 1582-10-15,00:00,288
 1582-10-05,00:00,278


 Please note that there is a 2 days gap between the Julian and the Gregorian
 calendar. The "julian" script converts dates based on the assumption that the
 gap was introduced in the Gregorian calendar right from the start. Otherwise
 the results wouldn't correspond to the current dates of the Julian calendar.
 The term "gap" here is used with respect to the current base of the calendar.

-The file "verification.txt" describes a comparison between the 6th century
 Paschal Table computed by Dionysius Exiguus and the dates computed by the
 bash script "easter" for a 114 years period (6 Metonic cycles) beginning in
 the 22nd century. The comparison is fully successful since Feb 25, 2018.

   
-The bash script "day" accepts a date-time of the Julian Calendar and computes
 how many days have passed from Dec 31, 1 BC.

 Two points make a line. The reader should already know basic math like that in
 order to understand the contents of this page and properly use i.e. the scripts
 "julian" and "day". The most qualified may benefit even more from math skills.

 According to Plato's "Republic", Socrates believed that skills in geometry, 
 astronomy, and especially mathematics (522c10-526c5) are crucial in the 
 education of philosophers as math can haul a philosopher to the light (521c). 

 Since then some time has passed but personally I accept Socrates' opinion
 without any further proof.


 Known Issues      
 --------------
 [Apr 12, 2018]

-Admittedly, I'm not an astronomer. If you find any errors in this project, an 
 e-mail will be highly appreciated.

-Regarding the Metonic cycle error, it seems to be on the average almost 1 day
 every 304 Julian years, known as the Hipparchic cycle. Wikipedia mentions that
 the 1 day correction proposed by Hipparchus deviates only by 0.014 days. 

 Having spent some time doing the math and then collecting data from two online
 servers (moongiant.com & timeanddate.com), I could identify a stable recurring 
 cycle where the 1 day error applies firmly to the Julian Calendar for the March 
 full moons. The years sequencing of this recursion is defined by the function: 

 y(e) = 16 * 19 * e + a, for e=0..15 and a=1  (likely also a=0, a=5, a=17, ...)

 If you start counting from March 28, 1 AD then every 304 years you find a full 
 moon one day earlier, finally in year 4561 on March 13 (note that the monthly
 calendar in timeanddate.com accepts dates lower than 4000 AD). To verify these
 dates, I've taken into account regional local time GMT+2 in Athens/Alexandria.


-Regarding the error of a 32 years cycle, it's likely between 6.1 and 6.9 days,  
 which means that a 33 lunar years period is just a week longer than this cycle.

 Every 14 cycles the accumulated error is nearly 3 lunar months, in which case 
 we find a full moon about 3 days earlier. I have identified a stable recurring
 cycle where this 3 days error applies firmly to the Julian Calendar. The years
 sequencing of this recursion is defined by the function:

 x(e) = 14 * 32 * (e/3) + c, for e=3*i, i=0..10 and c=33

 If you start counting from April 3, 33 AD then every 448 years you find a full 
 moon 3 days earlier, finally in year 4513 on March 4. To verify these dates, I
 have taken into account again regional local time GMT+2 in Athens/Alexandria.
 
 In addition to the Hipparchic cycle, this recursion confirms also precisely the
 full moon on March 22, 1825 (April 3, 1825 after the Gregorian calendar reform).


-City names like Athens ie aren't unique. The cities mentioned or
 related to this page are in the Eastern Mediterranean, ie:
                                           Latitude / Longitude  
 1. Athens:                              37.9838° N,  23.7275° E
 2. Constantinople (*nowadays Istanbul): 41.0082° N,  28.9784° E
 3. Alexandria:                          31.184245° / 29.875605°
 4. Jerusalem:                           31.7683° N,  35.2137° E


-A Paschal 14th may recur after 95 years on the same month date and weekday, but
 not always. At first, if we compare the year 316 to 411 ie we see that in 316 
 the Paschal 14th falls on Saturday March 24, whereas in 411 on Friday March 24.

 At second, if we apply the Metonic cycle error to year 411, we see that only the
 years 126, 221, 316, 506, 601, and 696 in this series could possibly had also a 
 new moon in spring on the same month date. This estimation is further restricted
 by modern astronomic applications between the years 316 and 601. That is, modern
 applications report that in 316, 411, 506, and 601 a new moon occurred on 10/3.
 
 So, a new moon may recur on the same weekday and month day after 95 years as ie 
 on Friday, March 10 in 411, 506, and 601 but such a recursion isn't guaranteed.

-Unless I run the Easter algorithm and read the results in year 31, I cannot find  
 a Jewish Passover on a Saturday, March 24 between the years 26 and 37.

 One can either use the formulas presented in the translation of the Easter Table
 or simply read in the Easter Table the results of the year 563 (31+532). You can
 find links to translations in file "verification.txt".


-Note that a new moon may recur after 46 years, ie the first new moon of spring 
 in 1454 (-14+1468) recurs on the same month date in year 1500 (32+1468) or the
 new moon of spring in 2922 (-14+1468*2) recurs in 2968 (32+1468*2), but I have
 not managed to identify two consecutive recursions in a row. Possibly, when it
 happens it's a one time recursion (it doesn't seem useful for error analysis).

 To verify these dates, I've used regional local time GMT+2 in Athens/Alexandria.


-According to Wikipedia, the Saros is a period of approximately 223 synodic months
 (approximately 6585.3211 days, or 18 years, 11 days, 8 hours) which can be used to
 predict lunar & solar eclipses. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saros_(astronomy)

 Using the "day" script, I could confirm a full moon recursion (without an Eclipse):

 α) Sat, March 26 14:38 UTC	              $ ./day --use 0012:03:26,14:38,086	     4103	 ψ) Thu, April  6 22:24 UTC	    $ ./day --use 0030:04:06,22:24,096	     10688	 Days 6585, Hours +7:46                   (manual subtraction)

 The above dates have been found in "moongiant.com". Similarly, I could confirm 
 also a full moon recursion with an eclipse. The eclipse is reported by NASA at:
 https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LE0001-0100.html

 β) Sun, April 24 22:10 UTC
    $ ./day --use 0012:04:24,22:10,115
     4132
 ω) Sat, May  6 05:41 UTC                 (ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων)
    $ ./day --use 0030:05:06,05:41,126    (ἐκαθαρίσθη ο Σάρος)     10718

 Days 6585, Hours +7:31                   (manual subtraction)
 

 Please note that a period of 6585.3 days might correspond to 18 years and 10.3 
 days as in the two examples above or to 18 years and 11.3 days if we measured 
 ie the period between the full moons on 29/3 9 AD and 9/4 27 AD.

 To my understanding, a safe conclusion is that a Saros can be used to predict
 not only a lunar eclipse but also a full moon without an eclipse as well. At 
 the same time we've crosschecked a few more results printed by "moongiant.com"
 for a period in the long past.

 The Ω Eclipse above is reported by NASA as the last one of Saros 41:
 https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEsaros/LEsaros041.html 


 Note: The reader should notice that all computations above are based on full
       moon events, not new moon plus fourteen days. In year 12 ie, we've a new
       moon on March 11, 13:27 UTC, fifteen days earlier from the 'α' full moon,
       which doesn't coincide with a passover, as also happens ie on Apr 3, 33.

-Regarding the length of the tropical year, the mean value 365.24219 printed
 by the program "tropical-year.f90" has been found in Wikipedia and after making
 the math I computed a one day deviation from the Julian Year every 128.04 years.

 The file "sol-limits.txt" contains values of the tropical year that correspond
 to one day deviation from the Julian Year precisely every 6 & 7 Metonic cycles.

 If we read some W. Solstice estimations for leap years in Beirut, the closest
 capital to the ancient city Ἡλιούπολις (Greek for "Sun City"), with Latitude
 33.8938° N, then we see that in 2088 a W. Solstice is estimated for the first
 time on Dec 20 (Dec 7 in the Julian Calendar). Whereas, the first solstice before
 the sunrise of Dec 21 (Dec 8 in the Julian cal.) is estimated for the year 2052:
 https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/seasons.html?year=2050&n=34

 Note here that the first W. Solstice on Dec 21 is estimated for the year 1952:
 https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/seasons.html?year=1950&n=34

 Whereas, the first solstice before the sunrise of Dec 9 (Julian) is estimated for
 the year 1916: https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/seasons.html?year=1900&n=34

 In both cases the "slipping" period in these estimations seems to be 136 years, a
 value close enough to the one used in the Gregorian calendar. Further, I have not 
 cross checked these estimations with another site or application. Yet, we have an
 approximative time frame for the W. solstice movements on the calendar in our era.

 Apart the etymology of the city name, Ἡλιούπολις is an arbitrarily chosen geographic
 position. Whatsoever, the local time zone in that region seems to be GMT+3. 
 
 Also, a W. solstice before the sunrise of Dec 21 is estimated for the year 2048 in
 Athens. Note that Greece has a dual time zone (+2 from Autumn and +3 from Spring)
 but likely this doesn't affect my conclusion that is based on the above estimations. 
 [Note that in 2044 the W. solstice is estimated just four minutes after the sunrise]

-The lunar-solar, syncrhonizations with weeks at the beginning of a leap year found
 on Sunday, January the 1st of the astronomical year -356 are too rare in the Julian  
 calendar, without even taking into account the possibility of a SOL event this day
 that would make the combination unique for million years (if not unique forever).

 It's a bit surprising that the Alexandrian astronomers who created the calendar had
 not noticed that and we cannot find any clue in the historic sources maintained by
 the Romans in late antiquity and thereafter in the middle ages. Of course I'm not
 a historian to assure you.
